# On the Domain {#top}

The *"Domain"* is the core of the application, it describes *what* our application is about.
The *"Domain"* tries to ignore *how* all these things are to be realized and effectuated in the outside world.
The correctness of *what* is paramount, if it can declare its intentions as to *why* it might do so.

The _when_[^when] is looked down upon as a practical detail and capturing it from an epochal perspective quite often suffices.

Since this is the core of the application, we would do well to keep it at the center of our design concerns.
It should be the beating heart, which steers the design direction.
Whose influence permeates the whole of the application.
We as technical people would do well to remember this and not let our technological preferences permeate the core.

## 1. Description {#theory}

* Describe the problem
* Explain why this is a problem; motivate a best practice
* Sum up the (theoretical) requirements of a solution

## 2. Technological parts of the solution {#techparts}

* Give an overview of technological solutions to this problem.
* Qualify/Quantify how they match to/interpret the requirements

## 3. Basic integration in your codebase {#basicIntegration}

* Describe how to implement this/these solution(s) in a codebase
* What to watch out for
* Call out specific impact on other code or the overall architecture

## 4. Semi "copy-paste"-able packaged example code {#prettySample}

* Provide a working sample
* Explain the choices you made
* Call out settings to tweak
